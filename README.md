Emailspy finds information from Facebook, Myspace, Yahoo Messenger, Google Profiles, Picasa, etc. for all e-mail addresses found in a page and displays them on mouse-over.

**[Note: This script isn't maintained any more.]**

**Version:** v1.0

Displays information about the owner of the e-mail address found in pages. Information includes name, photos, age, sex, address, interests, zodiac, profile links, etc.

The mashup is possible by employing Yahoo Pipes and Dapper and AJAX requests.
The information is displayed in a new pop-up division over e-mail addresses in the page.

E-mail can be validated with a single click (SMTP Validation).
Hi5 search is to be done manually with a single click because information isn't visible without logging in.

For now, the script looks for information in Facebook, MySpace, Google Profiles, Google Picasa, Yahoo Messenger, Yahoo Profiles(Pulse) and Flickr. Other networks and guessing mechanism will be added on future.
